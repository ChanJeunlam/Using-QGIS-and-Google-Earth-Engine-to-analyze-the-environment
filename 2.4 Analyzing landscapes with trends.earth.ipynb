    "# Analyzing land degradation with trends.earth\n",
    "GIS can be used to analyze the success and failures of different social development goals. [One of those goals is to make sure that the fraction of degraded land does not increase over time](https://youtu.be/y7uDAA_3VHk). Degraded land is defined by its carbon stocks and its productivity. This notebook here will take a look on how to study land degradation using the trend.earth plugin.  "

    "## Installing the trends.earth plugin for QGIS\n",
    "The goal of this course is to study land cover changes and understand them. One good tool for this is the [trends.earth\" toolbox](https://youtu.be/l_QY83p_yUI). This is basically a collection of nice algorithms to make working with land use data easier in QGIS. In addition, it runs its analysis directly in GEE. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it is a plugin, we first [have to install it](https://youtu.be/uSTvNMpZF4I). You [need a (free) user account](https://youtu.be/qm5LFF-jhaM) for the toolbox (feel free to enter fake data). \n",

    "First select soil organic carbon and click next. The next windows allows you to select the area you would like to have data from. Select here state of the country you were born in and click next. Give your selection an appropriate name and click *submit download request*.

Once it is finished, you can download it the same way as the data in exercise 1. This will provide you with five maps, each containing a subindicator of the land degradation indicator.\n",
