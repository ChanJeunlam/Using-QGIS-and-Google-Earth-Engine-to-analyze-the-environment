    "Google Earth Engine (GEE) has a so called Application Programming Interface (API). This basically means we can send order in the form of programming language to GEE to get a specific result. In the case of GEE you can use either Javascript or Python. In the case of this course we will be using Python. Don't worry, you don't have to becomme a full fledged programmer to manage this. You just need some basics. The best way to do this is not using the native [code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), but instead use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). [Google Colab](https://youtu.be/RLYoEyIHL6A) allows you to write Python code directly in your browser and also access GEE's API from there. In this way you can easily and conveniently work with Python and GEE and you don't even have to install anything on your computer. \n",
