    "# Analyzing land degradation with trend.earth\n",
    "GIS can be used to analyze the success and failures of different social development goals. [One of those goals is to make sure that the fraction of degraded land does not increase over time](https://youtu.be/y7uDAA_3VHk). Degraded land is defined by its carbon stocks and its productivity. This notebook here will take a look on how to study land degradation using the trend.earth plugin.  "

This is basically a collection of nice algorithms to make working with land use data easier in QGIS. As it is a plugin, we first [have to install it](https://youtu.be/uSTvNMpZF4I). You [need a (free) user account](https://youtu.be/qm5LFF-jhaM) for the toolbox (feel free to enter fake data). \n",
