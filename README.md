# Using-QGIS-to-understand-land-use-change
Repository for a QGIS course at the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen. This course is meant to get students from not knowing anything about QGIS, to being able to use it for a basic land use change analysis in combination with Google Earth Engine. The materials consits of juypter notebook. Those contain explanations, videos and exercises. All data for the exercises is also in this repository. Part 1 is about QGIS basics, part 2 tackles land use analysis. All notebooks are stored as Jupyter Notebooks. However, to provide them to the students it will make sense to convert them to html or pdf. 

The intended way to teach this course is the following:

This is a reversed classroom course, which means that the students are meant to take a look at the notebook on the day before class, watch all the videos and at least read the practice questions. In the classroom the students and teacher discuss the practice questions and then the students do the exercises on their own, but can ask the teacher at any time to help them out. This way enables the students to get the most knowledge out of their teachers and also allows students to even do this course with no teacher at all (though it is probably quite helpful to have one).

All exercises have to be submitted at certain deadlines. Some are graded, but all have to be submitted to get a grade. The exercises that are meant to be graded are: 

* Exercise 1 in Notebook 1.1 (10 points)
* Exercise 1 in Notebook 1.2 (5 points)
* Exercise 3 in Notebook 2.4 (15 points)
* Exercise 2 in Notebook 2.5 (15 points)
