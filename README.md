## Course structure
Repository for a QGIS course at the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen. This course is meant to get students from not knowing anything about QGIS, to being able to use it for a basic land use change analysis in combination with Google Earth Engine. The materials consits of juypter notebook. Those contain explanations, videos and exercises. All data for the exercises is also in this repository. Part 1 is about QGIS basics, part 2 tackles land use analysis in QGIS with Google Earth Engine data and part 3 is about using the Google Earth Engine via the Python API. All notebooks are stored as Jupyter Notebooks. However, to provide them to the students it will make sense to convert them to html or pdf. 

The intended way to teach this course is the following:

The students are meant to take a look at the notebook on their own. They have to watch all the videos and do all the exercises. There are regular Q&A sessions were students can ask questions about the course in the group. In addition, students can book appointments with the teacher to get 1on1 feedback (easiest way to implement this is [calendly](https://calendly.com/)). This is especially important for the final project. 

## Grading and schedule


This course is to be taught over a 12 week period. All graded exercises have to be submitted at certain deadlines. The exercises that are meant to be graded are:
