    "Like the interactive mode we will do this with Google Colab. However, using the API with Google Colab [gives us access to more functions](https://youtu.be/8FUjFVo4iuo). You can find the notebook used in the presentation [here](https://g.co/earth/colab-ee), so you can follow along and play around with it. So, as you can see, you do not really have to program here. You just have to learn which specific lines of code do what. Once you got the data you want, you can export it and continue working with it in QGIS. Take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/k5xX8iBH7Cs) how those extended capabilities of GEE can be used to work on sustainable development goals as well (The Video uses Javascript, don't worry if you don't get the code). You can use [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/intro-to-python-api) to take a look at code examples and explanations for the API. You can also look at the [documentation of all the methods in the API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/api_docs). "

Images are composed of bands and a dictionary of properties. Features are composed of a **`Geometry`** and a dictionary of properties. A stack of images (e.g. an image time series) is handled by an **`ImageCollection`**. A collection of features is handled by a  **`FeatureCollection`**. Other fundamental data structures in Earth Engine include:\n",
