One example is [MODIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate_Resolution_Imaging_Spectroradiometer) (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), which allows us to detect droughts. Detecting droughts is an important task, as it allows to determine which regions need help to avoid agricultural failures. \n",

To assess the strength of the drought we use the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We'll focus on California and you can find the data [here](https://github.com/florianjehn/Using-QGIS-to-understand-land-use-change/tree/main/Exercise%20Materials/Materials%20for%202.5/Data_NDVI)."
