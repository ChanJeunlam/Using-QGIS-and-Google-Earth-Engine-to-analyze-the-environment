    "# Reducer Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducers are the way to aggregate data over time, space, bands, arrays and other data structures in Earth Engine. The `ee.Reducer` class specifies how data is aggregated. The reducers in this class can specify a simple statistic to use for the aggregation (e.g. minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation, etc.), or a more complex summary of the input data (e.g. histogram, linear regression, list). Reductions may occur over:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **time**  = `imageCollection.reduce()`\n",
    "- **space** = `image.reduceRegion()` and `image.reduceNeighborhood()`**\n",
    "- **bands**  = `image.reduce()`,\n",
    "\n",
    "Or the attribute space of a `FeatureCollection` (`featureCollection.reduceColumns()` or `FeatureCollection` methods that start with `aggregate_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reducers have inputs and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducers take an input dataset and produce a single output. When a single input reducer is applied to a multi-band image, Earth Engine automatically replicates the reducer and applies it separately to each band. As a result, the output image has the same number of bands as the input image; each band in the output is the reduction of pixels from the corresponding band in the input data. Some reducers take tuples of input datasets. These reducers will not be automatically replicated for each band. For example, `ee.Reducer.LinearRegression()` takes multiple predictor datasets (representing independent variables in the regression) in a particular order (see Regression reducers section bellow).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some reducers produce multiple outputs, for example `ee.Reducer.minMax()`, `ee.Reducer.histogram()` or `ee.Reducer.toList()`. For example:"
