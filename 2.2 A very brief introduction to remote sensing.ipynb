    "## The basics of remote sensing\n",
    "The basis for remote sensing is using the electromagnetic spectrum to get spatial information. Much of this is done in the visible spectrum. However, we can also do remote sensing in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum like infrared. This works, because different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum interact differently with the surfaces they hit. For example, visible light passes through windows easily, UV-light is partly blocked. We can use those effects to get different kinds of information from remote sensing.  \n",

    "## How do we get remote sensing data?\n",
    "Remote sensing is mostly done with satellites in different orbits. Those satelites contain sensor, which allow them to detect certain wavelengths. The sensor detects how much of a given wavelength is reflected back to it from Earth. This information is usually shown as a raster, where the values represent how much of this wavelength was reflected back. \n",

    "## Using multispectral information\n",
    "While we have many useful applications for single wavelengths, there are many cases where you want to combine the information of several ranges of wavelengths to really get the full picture. This is using multispectral information, for example using infrared in combination with visible light. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we visualize the bands we can also make visible things that aren't in the range of human eyes. The satelite detects infrared light, this gives us an infrared value for each pixel. We can then visualize this value by assigning it to a color the human eye can detect, like e.g. \"normal\" red. This results in images like this:\n",
