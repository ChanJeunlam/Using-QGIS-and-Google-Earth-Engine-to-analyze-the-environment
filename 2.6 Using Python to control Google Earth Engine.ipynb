    "# Using Python to control Google Earth Engine\n",
    "Google Earth Engine (GEE) has a so called Application Programming Interface (API). This basically means we can send order in the form of programming language to GEE to get a specific result. In the case of GEE you can use either Javascript or Python. In the case of this course we will be using Python. Don't worry, you don't have to becomme a full fledged programmer to manage this. You just need some basics. The best way to do this is not using the native [code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), but instead use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). [Google Colab](https://youtu.be/RLYoEyIHL6A) allows you to write Python code directly in your browser and also access GEE's API from there. In this way you can easily and conveniently work with Python and GEE and you don't even have to install anything on your computer. "

You can find the notebook used in the presentation [here](https://g.co/earth/colab-ee), so you can follow along and play around with it. So, as you can see, you do not really have to program here. You just have to learn which specific lines of code do what. Once you got the data you want, you can export it and continue working with it in QGIS. Take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/k5xX8iBH7Cs) how those extended capabilities of GEE can be used to work on sustainable development goals as well (The Video uses Javascript, don't worry if you don't get the code). You can use [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/intro-to-python-api) to take a look at code examples and explanations for the API. "
