    "# Preprocessing remote sensing images\n",
    "While GEE provides us with a vast amount of remote sensing data, we still have to preprocess it sometimes, as they raw data is not sufficient for our needs. This could be something like removing clouds, so we can extract the data for all locations or changing the projection of the data, so it fits to the rest of our project. "

For this, we need another plugin for QGIS: [Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP)](https://fromgistors.blogspot.com/p/semi-automatic-classification-plugin.html). Just install it the same way you did with trend.earth. Fortunately the developer also provides [with a tutorial video](https://youtu.be/Ceyhm3DlZNY?t=20)."
